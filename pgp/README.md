# PGP Key

This directory lists my PGP keys.
While I do renew my PGP keys, I often find the need to replace them entirely.
I will keep them in this directory for legacy verification purposes.

## Integrity

This entire directory can be verified using [medhash-tools](https://github.com/Ghifari160/medhash-tools).
Each key's SHA256 Sum will also be listed below.
