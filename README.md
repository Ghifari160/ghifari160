## About Me

Hi!
I'm Ghifari (he/him)!

I've been coding for as long as I remember.
In my free time, I enjoy coding tools that will help me build more tools.
In other words, _I code stuff so that I can easily code more stuff._

When I'm not coding or reading, I like to play video games with friends.
I love playing story-driven games and sandbox games.
Space sims are my guilty pleasure.

I can code in a growing number of languages including the ones listed below:

- C#
- C
- C++
- Go
- PHP
- Java
- JavaScript
- Lua

I actively strive to learn other languages.

I learn best through projects.
I will work on a new project with a different language than what I'm familiar with just to learn.
