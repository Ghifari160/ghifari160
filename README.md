## About Me

Hi!
I'm Ghifari ([he/him](https://pronoun.is/he/him))!

I've been coding for as long as I remember.
In my free time, I enjoy coding tools that will help me build more tools.
In other words, _I code stuff so that I can easily code more stuff._
The [portfolio](#portfolio) section below lists a few of my projects.

When I'm not coding or reading, I like to play video games with friends.
I love playing story-driven games and sandbox games.
Space sims are my guilty pleasure.

I can code in a growing number of languages including the ones listed below:

- C#
- C
- C++
- PHP
- Java
- JavaScript
- Lua

I actively strive to learn other languages.
I'm currently learning Go.

I learn best through projects.
I will work on a new project with a different language than what I'm familiar with just to learn.
