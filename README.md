# Hi, I'm Ghi

I've been coding for as long as I remember.
In my free time, I enjoy coding tools that will help me build more tools.
In other words, _I code stuff so that I can easily code more stuff._

I'm also the Head of Operations at [Diamond Drake Ventures].
Essentially, I manage the day-to-day operations, write custom tools when needed, and maintain the
infrastructure.
I also edit core content.

## Things I like to do

Code, game, produce content, repeat.

## Skills

tl;dr: Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Linux, and containers.
In-depth list [here](skills.md).
