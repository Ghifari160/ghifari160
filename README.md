# Hi, I'm Ghi

I've been coding for as long as I remember.
In my free time, I enjoy coding tools that will help me build more tools.
In other words, _I code stuff so that I can easily code more stuff._

## Things I like to do

Code, game, produce content, repeat.

## Skills

tl;dr: Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Linux, and containers.
In-depth list [here](skills.md).

## Projects
